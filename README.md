This repository contains the codes, data and major results of our proposed clustering methodology.

# Studied DHNs

17 DHNs have been studied in this work. The topology files and visualisation figures can be found in [the studied DHNs folder](studied_dhns/)

# Requirements

To install all required packages, enter the following line commands at the project source folder

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

# Codes sources

All code sources can be found in [the source folder](src/). An example of performing the clustering is proposed in the proposed example.ipynb which presents in great details how to perform the clustering. We recall to the readers that the physical simulation states data of the DHNs are not available in this repository due to their memory sizes. However, they can be made available at request.
